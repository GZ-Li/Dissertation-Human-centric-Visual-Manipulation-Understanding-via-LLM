We propose a pipeline containing two core methods: Visual Information Checking (VIC) and Taxonomy Guideline. VIC is implemented as the 'VIC.py', and the details of the Taxonomy Guideline can be found in 'pipeline.py'. 

To generate the description of the manipulation between a given image pair, you can call the *get_edits* function in 'pipeline.py' as:
'''from pipeline import get_edits'''
